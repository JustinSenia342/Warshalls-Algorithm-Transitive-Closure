# Warshalls-Algorithm-Transitive-Closure
Java - Warshalls Algorithm used to demonstrate transitive closure

This program takes in 3 seperate external files, reads in the first number
to use as matrix size dimensions, then reads in the remaining data,
finds the transitive closure on it via warshalls algorithm.
Then writes the resulting binary matrix from the transitive closure to a file.
